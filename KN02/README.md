### Abgabe Aufgabe A

I did a conceptual model diagram of my music school. There are five entites: music school, teachers, students, instruments and classrooms. The idea is to demonstrate the simplified structure of my school. Teachers teach at the school and have several class rooms. Class rooms can either have 1 teacher or many. Teachers have multiple students and each student has only one teacher (because it's private lessons). Students have one instrument to learn with the teacher.
